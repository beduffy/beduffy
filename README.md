My journey through technology:

- Hobby Game Development (2014-2017)
- Web Development (2015+. Every job I have had needs it)
- Computer Vision (2015+)
- Deep Learning (2014+)
- Data Science and Engineering, NLP (2017-2019)
- Reinforcement Learning (2017-2019)
- Full-stack Robotics: hardware (actuators, sensors, mechatronics and rapid prototyping) and software (perception, control, SLAM, navigation, manipulation, integration and testing). I love this because everything I have learned previously coalesces and accumulates to be useful for this field. (2019+)
- Radar and Digital Signal Processing. Trying to sense breathing through walls (2021+)
