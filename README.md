**My journey through technology**:

- Hobby Game Development (2014-2017)
- Web Development (2015+): Every job I have had required it
- Computer Vision (2015+)
- Deep Learning (2014+)
- Data Science and Engineering, NLP (2017-2019)
- Reinforcement Learning (2017-2019)
- Full-stack Robotics (2019+): hardware (actuators, sensors, mechatronics and rapid prototyping) and software (perception, control, SLAM, navigation, manipulation, integration and testing). I love this because everything I have learned previously coalesces and compounds to be useful to some extent for this field.
- Radar and Digital Signal Processing (2021+): Trying to sense breathing through walls
- Learning CAD + 3D printing for personal mechatronics + software projects (2023+)
